		<h2>ACOUSTIC</h2>
		<p>
			An acoustic guitar is a musical instrument in the guitar family, that projects a sound wave from its vibrating strings through the air. The original, general term for the stringed instrument was called a guitar, while the retronym 'acoustic guitar' was created to distinguish it from an electric guitar which relies on an electronic amplification system.

		<h2>ELECTRIC</h2>
		<p>
			Invented in 1932, the electric guitar was adopted by jazz guitar players, who wanted to play single-note guitar solos in large big band ensembles. Early proponents of the electric guitar on record include Les Paul, Lonnie Johnson, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, T-Bone Walker, and Charlie Christian

		<h2>BASS</h2>
		<p>
			The bass guitar, electric bass, or simply bass, is the lowest-pitched member of the guitar family. It is a plucked string instrument similar in appearance and construction to an electric or an acoustic guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and typically four to six strings or courses. Since the mid-1950s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the double bass in popular music.
