                <h2>Acoustic</h2>
                <p>
                  An acoustic guitar is a musical instrument in the guitar family, that projects a sound wave from its vibrating strings through the air. The original, general term for the stringed instrument was called a guitar, while the retronym 'acoustic guitar' was created to distinguish it from an electric guitar which relies on an electronic amplification system.

                <h2>Electric</h2>
                <p>
                 Invented in 1932, the electric guitar was adopted by jazz guitar players, who wanted to play single-note guitar solos in large big band ensembles. Early proponents of the electric guitar on record include Les Paul, Lonnie Johnson, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, T-Bone Walker, and Charlie Christian. I personally favour an electric guitar more than the others.

                <h2>Bass</h2>
                <p>
                    The bass guitar(electric bass) is the lowest-pitched member of the guitar family. It is a plucked string instrument similar in appearance and construction to an electric or an acoustic guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and typically four to six strings. Since the mid-1950s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the double bass in popular music.
